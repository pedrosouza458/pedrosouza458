# Hey 👋🏻

I am a Internet Systems student at IFSUL Campus Charqueadas, currently in the third semester of the Internet Systems Technologist course. In high school, I also studied Computer Science at IFSul. Im studying Java and Typescript. In my institute, i earned three hackatons in a row (2022, 2023 and 2024) with projects for my region. I am looking for opportunities to showcase my current knowledge and develop it further.
