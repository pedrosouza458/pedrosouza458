# Hey 👋🏻

I'm a Backend developer currently in my third semester of the Internet Systems program at IFSul. During high school, I also completed an IT Technician course at the same institution. I'm focused on Java with Spring and TypeScript with Node.js.
At IFSul, I won three consecutive hackathons (2022, 2023, and 2024) with regional impact projects built using my tech stack. I'm actively developing new projects and seeking opportunities to showcase my skills and continue growing as a developer.
