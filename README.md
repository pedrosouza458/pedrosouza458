# Hey 👋🏻

I am a Internet Systems student at IFSUL Campus Charqueadas, currently in the third semester of the Internet Systems Technologist course. In high school, I also study IT technician. Im studying Java with Spring and Typescript with Node. In my institute, i earned three hackatons in a row (2022, 2023 and 2024) with projects for my region using my tech stack. I am looking for opportunities to showcase my current knowledge and develop it further.
