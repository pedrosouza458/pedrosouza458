🔹 Projects and Initiatives

CarboJobs: Application for advertising service providers and scheduling appointments with them. Winning project of the IFSul Charqueadas Hackathon 2022.

CalamiAlert: Application for warning of possible floods and listing requests for help, focusing on Porto Alegre and the region. Winning project of the IFSul Charqueadas Hackathon 2023.

Accesible: Application for companies affected by floods in the south. Companies register and show available vacancies, while users can support and apply for vacancies, with the help of geolocation to find nearby companies. Winning project of the IFSul Charqueadas Hackathon 2024.

🔹 Languages ​​Studied
- Typescript: The primary language for web development. It replaces Javascript, which was the main focus in my high school, in the Web Development subjects (done in PHP at the time, Javascript, HTML and CSS).
- Golang: Fast and versatile language mainly for creating APIs oriented to micro-services.
- Rust: Low-level language chosen by me to explore concepts seen in C in college and to create applications that require extreme speed and security.

🔹 Additional Technologies

- NodeJS: Technology to create Javascript/Typescript APIs and run Javascript/Typescript Frameworks.
- React / NextJS: Library and framework for creating interactive websites.
- React Native: Version of React for mobile, useful because in addition to being similar to React, it is multi-platform, being compatible with iOS and Android. - Tailwind CSS: CSS framework for developing styling patterns.
